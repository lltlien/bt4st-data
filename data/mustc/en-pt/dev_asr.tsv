ted_767_0	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:15698062:47621	56159	I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.	spk.767	en
ted_767_1	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:10268961:201817	226080	And that might seem a bit surprising, because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives.	spk.767	en
ted_767_2	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:2885636:119178	141920	But energy and climate are extremely important to these people; in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.	spk.767	en
ted_767_3	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:15507888:190130	227840	The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow: there will be too much rain, not enough rain; things will change in ways their fragile environment simply can't support.	spk.767	en
ted_767_4	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:728970:54691	59200	And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.	spk.767	en
ted_767_5	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:17187854:42137	47840	So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.	spk.767	en
ted_767_6	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:12393922:41592	45919	Also, the price of energy is very important to them.	spk.767	en
ted_767_7	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:10768068:92672	110080	In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.	spk.767	en
ted_767_8	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:16371168:41041	44160	Now, the price of energy has come down over time.	spk.767	en
ted_767_9	/home/lltlien/Downloads/nckh/data/en-pt/flac.zip:10604109:88364	100000	Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.	spk.767	en
